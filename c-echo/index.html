Nowadays, people’s busy lives often make them ignoring the feeling from nature. This app can help people find the exciting thing that it can convert the noise into a melody. The voice can help people relaxing. As a result, this apps original conception is that I wanna help people back to the natural and release the pressures.</p> <div class=title style=margin-top:50px>ROLE</div> <p class=text>UX design</p> <div class=title style=margin-top:50px>INVESTIGATION</div> <p class=text>A big challenge that many of the ideas generated in my mind faced was that the product needed to be adopted by society at large, and the most important thing that I wanna know people’s feeling of music and noise. In order to be accepted by society at large, I investigated 100 people from 12 year old to 65 year old. </p> <p class=text>The investigation <a href=https://wj.qq.com/s/2283009/3846/ >please click here:</a></p> <p class=text>The result of investigation:</p> <div class=swiper-container> <div class=swiper-wrapper> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/315c2470383e1fd3b7474f49761895da.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/946b4b94c2c310d6b6347fade437a619.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/e0d10d4b4ca79c2e340ca8d6886c7f1c.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/9fba1014c1447ca171d8c87702d2ef1e.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/d100fa1201b4105a176ad13659d4546d.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/6897fd1a11401ffc947b200e6b44cd5e.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/94b421a72c7da6af51c8f3f9e3a85a57.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/cd13f51767cd9480fffd1aac6bb603e2.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/986a141349139aeb45c0c0ea7b936f20.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/b0b7b10bafaca842989ad70b41ce7d24.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/6b373c737f9b4fd942c2a9eaa7d665d4.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/506699fa576e14a2fe83a2c9ac0930a3.png alt=""></div> </div> <div class=swiper-pagination></div> <div class=swiper-button-prev></div> <div class=swiper-button-next></div> <div class=swiper-scrollbar></div> </div> <div class=title style=margin-top:50px>IDEATION</div> <p class=text>The overall design conception for this project was to come up with a noise detector which can cleanly recognize noise and reduce noise decibel, and meanwhile, this product also included a system to convert the noise into melodies. I decided to approach this topic through the angle of the catchphrase “ the nature is always around you”- in other words, even though the noises around people, we can change it and convert it into a melody. It means that the nature is around you -- people just need to use this product, which can help you reduce the noise and make you feel the nature is always around you. This project took me two months to complete the conception. My idea was that if some material can help people reduce noise decibel, it maybe can convert the noise into melodies.</p> <div class=img style="margin:20px 0"> <img src=./images/ae9ea8a8556027adfe2426b0caa6e0a3.png alt=""> </div> <p class=text>Around the two main human motives-the bored to generate the noise, as well as our desire to creative the relaxing environmental-as interaction incentive for users, the product can have reaction for people's directive. Therefore, I wanna this product can add interaction function to attract the users to enjoy this product.</p> <div class=title style=margin-top:50px>CONCEPT DESIGN</div> <div class=title style=margin-top:20px>C-echo system product gave your relaxing environmental.</div> <p class=text>the users can use this product to reduce the noise around them, and it also can convert the noise into melodies.In addition, the user can collect their favorite melodies voice around them to convert into the note and create a new melody.</p> <div class=title style=margin-top:30px>Conception Main Steps</div> <p class=text>Firstly, distinguishing the noise hertz and reducing noise decibel;</p> <p class=text>Secondly, transposing the noise hertz into notes;</p> <p class=text>Thirdly, collecting different kinds of voices from natural;</p> <p class=text>Fourthly, transposing the noise hertz into notes;</p> <p class=text>Fifthly, users regulate frequency, and then automatically generates music;</p> <div class=img style="margin:20px 0"> <img src=./images/538e625398a86acd92fa8c78629b5eb2.png alt=""> </div> <div class=title style=margin-top:50px>PHYSICS PROTOTYPE（2D illustration）</div> <p class=text>In order for people be attracted, this product should be designed as something that it was easy taking. Therefore, this product based on a home application prototype to design. This product used a a noise detector to recognize the noise and transmit the information to phone by Bluetooth. Therefore, the user can use phone to regulate the needs to create the environmental for they needs.This physical prototype is a multifunction product.</p> <div class=swiper-container style=width:100%;height:430px> <div class=swiper-wrapper> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/6dd5cb6a89dfa8c33ffe691421b54455.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/6e1216f700f04fdb99082a98c978ed44.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/a0722a36fa9b7f428db410a677dedaf4.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/c2704e6ccb813e7f5f17ccd6d2fbc06d.png alt=""></div> <div class=swiper-slide><img src=./images/10e1edb83f407a04a590677ba12b490d.png alt=""></div> </div> <div class=swiper-pagination></div> </div> <div class=title style=margin-top:50px>UI PROTOTYPE</div> <p class=text>The interaction function and melodies making are on C-echo app. Therefore , I make three main pages to show this app, respectively the homepage, the search page and the personal page.In order to attract more users, I also focus on more details to design.</p> <div class=img style="margin:20px 0"> <img src=./images/af97c4ee59f43df0e192704beca5ff30.png alt=""> </div> <div class=title style=margin-top:10px>UI PRODUCTION</div> <div class=img style="margin:20px 0"> <img src=./images/02daa222081a81bab7c03aeae167a40a.gif alt=""> </div> <div class=title style=margin-top:50px>OUTCOME</div> <p class=text>During this product design, I had an in-depth comprehension with User Experience Design although this product is not perfect. In addition, I had a good experience through this work.I received some great suggestions for further improvements , and these suggestions are important for me. Additionally, from this product, people can use this product to change the attitude for noise and make it as a leisure activity.</p> <p class=text>Lastly, everyone’s preference and sense of design highly depends on our life experiences and our own view toward the world. Only through the user angle thinking, this product be accepted by more people.the Overall, it is important to keep in mind that as product designers is to design for users, and not just for ourselves!</p> <p class=text style="text-align:center;width:100%;height:20px;border-bottom:1px dashed #666"> <over> </over></p> <div class=title style="margin:50px 0;font-weight:100;text-align:center">OTHER PORTFOLIO</div> <ul class=footerList> <li class="left item"><img src=./images/b7838d595799d499fcda30a1b32235fa.png alt=""></li> <li class="left item"><img src=./images/32b8255940ab0ead1398b53689410bb1.png alt=""></li> <li class="left item"><img src=./images/f11aa50c79f5a9071427491809403de8.png alt=""></li> </ul> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="js/1ca5ecfa55089c4a6654.js"></script></body> </html>
